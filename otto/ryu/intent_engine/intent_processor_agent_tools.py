    Function to add an OpenFlow group to a switch.
    Args:
        switch_id: ID of the switch (in decimal)
        bucket_type: Can either be one of the four options: SELECT, ALL, INDIRECT and FAST-FAILOVER.
        SELECT: In a SELECT group, each bucket in the group has an assigned weight.
        Each packet that enters the group is sent to a single bucket. The bucket selection algorithm
        is undefined and is dependent on the switchâ€™s implementation; however, weighted round robin is perhaps
        the most obvious and simplest choice of packet distribution to buckets. The weight of a bucket is provided as a
        special parameter to each bucket. Each bucket in a SELECT group is still a list of actions, so any actions
        supported by OpenFlow can be used in each bucket, and like the ALL group, the buckets need not be uniform.

        ALL: Will take any packet received as input and duplicate it to be operated on independently by each bucket
        in the bucket list. In this way, an ALL group can be used to replicate and then operate on separate copies of the packet
        defined by the actions in each bucket. Different and distinct actions can be in each bucket,
        which allows different operations to be performed on different copies of the packet.

        INDIRECT: contains only a single bucket where all packets received by the group are sent to this lone bucket.
        In other words, the INDIRECT group does not contain a list of buckets but a single bucket (or single list of actions) instead.
        The purpose of the INDIRECT group is to encapsulate a common set of actions used by many flows. For example, if flows A, B, and C match on different packet headers but have a common set or subset of actions,
        these flows can send packets to the single INDIRECT group as opposed to having to duplicate the list of common actions for each flow.

        group_id: ID for the given group.
        buckets: List of buckets for the group, where each bucket is defined in a dictionary. Each bucket should
        have an "actions" key, which holds a dictionary for the action. For example, {"type": "OUTPUT", "port": 1}
        For a SELECT group for load balancing, a "weight" key should be added to the bucket dictionary, e.g:
         [
            {
                "weight": 100,
                "actions": [
                    {
                        "type": "OUTPUT",
                        "port": 1
